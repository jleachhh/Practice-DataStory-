          <h2>Introduction: Why Student Health Matters</h2>

          
<p>School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) are a vital part of Connecticut's public health infrastructure. In areas where pediatric and adolescent health care, as well as family resources, are limited, SBHCs provide essential medical, dental, and mental health services. However, not all SBHCs offer the same combination of services, and access varies significantly across school districts.This data story explores these differences from two perspectives. First, we examine which service combinations are most common across Connecticut schools. Second, we investigate whether there is a correlation between student income levels and the availability of SBHC services, with a particular focus on whether low-income families are receiving the support they need.</p>

<p>To understand these differences, the first part of our analysis focused on the guiding question: “How do SBHCs vary by types of services: medical, dental, and/or mental health?” Using the full statewide dataset provided for this project by the Connecticut Association of School-based Health Centers, we categorized each SBHC based on its available services, combining Dental and Mobile Dental into a single category for consistency. We then organized the data into two groups: those that offer only one service and those that provide multiple services, to compare service frequency across different SBHCs. This structure allowed us to identify both the prevalence of single service centers and the most common service combinations. The following sections present our findings, beginning with SBHCs that offer only one service and then examining schools that deliver two or more services.</p>

<p>Next, we wanted to answer our second guiding question: how do student and school resources affect SBHC access? Since SBHCs fill gaps that private practice fails to provide due to cost, insurance, and/or proximity, among other reasons, we wanted to see whether low-income families were getting the full spectrum of care they needed. We found, as will be shown later, that low-income schools tend to offer all three services at a higher rate than their middle- and high-income counterparts, indicating that SBHCs are filling the gaps they intended to. </p>

          <h2>Service Distribution</h2>

          <p>To answer the question "How do SBHCs vary by types of services: medical, dental, and/or mental health?” we analyzed the full dataset of School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) in Connecticut and organized the sites into two major categories:
<div(1) SBHCs offering only one service, and>
<div(2) SBHCs offering multiple services.>
For clarity, we combined Dental and Mobile Dental into a single category, since both represent dental care delivered through the SBHC—even if delivered in different formats.
Focusing first on SBHCs that provide a single service only, our analysis found that Dental-only sites were the most common, with 55 schools (16.42% of all SBHCs). Mental Health–only centers were the next most common, totaling 37 schools (11.04% of all SBHCs). Medical-only SBHCs were rare, appearing in just 6 schools (1.79% of all SBHCs). Importantly, these counts exclude any SBHCs that offer more than one service. For example, a center offering both Medical and Dental services would not be counted in the “Medical-only” or “Dental-only” categories.
The table below illustrates these findings by showing the number of SBHCs that offer only one service and what percentage of all SBHCs each category represents.

          </script>
  
<p>In addition to examining single-service SBHCs, we also analyzed schools that offer multiple types of services within the same health center. This revealed a very different pattern: most SBHCs in Connecticut provide two or more services, with Mental Health appearing in nearly all common combinations. The two largest groups were SBHCs offering Mental Health + Medical services and those offering the full combination of Mental Health + Medical + Dental, each totaling 84 schools (25.30% of all SBHCs). Another substantial group included SBHCs that provide Mental Health + Dental services, accounting for 64 schools (19.28%). By contrast, very few schools—only 5 sites (1.51%)—offered Medical + Dental without Mental Health.
These findings indicate that while single-service SBHCs exist, the majority rely on a multi-service model, with Mental Health services serving as a consistent core component. The table below summarizes the counts and percentages for each service combination.

<h2>Income and Services</h2>

          
<p>To meaningfully compare schools by income level, we grouped them into three categories (low, middle, and high) based on the percentage of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch, a common proxy for family income. The histogram below displays the distribution of schools in smaller buckets, which helps us understand the spread of the data. We used the 33rd percentile, median, and 67th percentile to define our three income groups, allowing us to visualize how schools with different income compositions are distributed across Connecticut.

<p>To examine how income relates to SBHC service availability, we developed a simple scoring system. Each school received a score from 0 to 3 based on the number of service types it offered (medical, dental, and mental health). For example, a school offering all three services scored a 3, while a school offering none scored a 0. Combined with our income groupings based on free- and reduced-price lunch eligibility, this allowed us to analyze whether lower-income schools have different levels of SBHC access than their higher-income counterparts.</p>
          
<p> Our findings, shown below, were promising. Schools serving predominantly low-income students had the highest proportion of comprehensive, three-service SBHCs, suggesting that these centers are successfully targeting the communities that need them most. This is particularly important because students from lower-income families often face greater barriers to accessing healthcare outside of school, making SBHCs a critical safety net for their well-being.</p>
