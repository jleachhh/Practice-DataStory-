          <h2>Introduction: Why Student Health Matters</h2>

          
          <p>School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) are a vital part of Connecticut's public health infrastructure. In areas where pediatric and adolescent health care, as well as family resources, are suboptimal, SBHCs are crucial for providing this essential care. Though not consistent amongst all SBHCs, these facilities offer medical, dental, and or mental health services. Despite the massive role they play, there remains a significant difference not only in the care offered —whether medical, dental, or mental health —but also in access to care across school districts. If the SBHCs are working well, these less fortunate communities, who can not afford private practice, will likely have an abundance of services offered.</p>

          

 <p>The aim of this data story is to explore differences in access and why there is a discrepancy across the state. First, we aim to do this by looking at the distribution of services offered generally across schools to get a sense of what is ‘typically’ offered. Next, we wanted to see whether there was a relationship between students' income levels and the SBHCSs offered, to address the central concern with SBHCs, which is to assist families in need. However, as with many public services, communities that are worse off tend to lack the same SBHC resources as their affluent counterparts, even though their students have less access to health care. We hope that after seeing our data story, you, like us, feel compelled to understand more about SBHCs and the irreplaceable role they play in their communities. </p>

          <h2>Service Distribution</h2>

          <p>To answer the question "How do SBHCs vary by types of services: medical, dental, and/or mental health?” we analyzed the full dataset of School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) in Connecticut and organized the sites into two major categories:
<div(1) SBHCs offering only one service, and>
<div(2) SBHCs offering multiple services.>
For clarity, we combined Dental and Mobile Dental into a single category, since both represent dental care delivered through the SBHC—even if delivered in different formats.
Focusing first on SBHCs that provide a single service only, our analysis found that Dental-only sites were the most common, with 55 schools (16.42% of all SBHCs). Mental Health–only centers were the next most common, totaling 37 schools (11.04% of all SBHCs). Medical-only SBHCs were rare, appearing in just 6 schools (1.79% of all SBHCs). Importantly, these counts exclude any SBHCs that offer more than one service. For example, a center offering both Medical and Dental services would not be counted in the “Medical-only” or “Dental-only” categories.
The table below illustrates these findings by showing the number of SBHCs that offer only one service and what percentage of all SBHCs each category represents.

          </script>
  
<p>In addition to examining single-service SBHCs, we also analyzed schools that offer multiple types of services within the same health center. This revealed a very different pattern: most SBHCs in Connecticut provide two or more services, with Mental Health appearing in nearly all common combinations. The two largest groups were SBHCs offering Mental Health + Medical services and those offering the full combination of Mental Health + Medical + Dental, each totaling 84 schools (25.30% of all SBHCs). Another substantial group included SBHCs that provide Mental Health + Dental services, accounting for 64 schools (19.28%). By contrast, very few schools—only 5 sites (1.51%)—offered Medical + Dental without Mental Health.
These findings indicate that while single-service SBHCs exist, the majority rely on a multi-service model, with Mental Health services serving as a consistent core component. The table below summarizes the counts and percentages for each service combination.

<h2>Income and Services</h2>
          
<p>To answer the question regarding the role income (as a resource proxy) plays in the distribution of SBHC, we had to undergo a few key steps to ensure that we could find the results we wanted. Our first task was to find an easy way to count the services offered at each school, which we did by assigning a 1 or 0 if a service was offered. That is to say, if a school offered all three services, they would score a 3, and if they did not, they would receive a 0. Then we used free, reduced, and non-subsidized lunch as a proxy to determine the percentage of low-income students at a school. We then added the percentage of free and reduced lunches to be a proxy for low-income students. We then found the median, 33rd percentile, and 67th percentile to determine whether a school was low-, middle-, or high-income. </p>

   <p>The chart below shows the availability of SBHC across different income levels. Though direct income data is inaccessible, for the privacy of children and their families, we decided, as is common practice, to use free, reduced, and non-subsidized as a proxy for income. Schools were then grouped into low, middle, and high income based on the percentage of students who qualify for free or reduced price lunch. Each bar represents the number of schools in that income group offering 0-3 SBHC services. What we see is a clear pattern: low-income schools are much more likely to offer only one or two services, while high-income schools are more than twice as likely to offer all three.</p>
